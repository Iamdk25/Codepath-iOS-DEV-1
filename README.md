## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite apps and their favorite features.
- [ ] Instagram: Fluid UI, Cross-platform integration, In-built video editor.
- [ ] Snapchat: Disappearing messages, Camera Filters, Know your friend's location.
- [ ] Spotify: Connect to logged-in devices easily, Recommendation engine, and Track what your friends are listening to.
- [ ] Apple Weather app: Beautiful AI, Accurate results, Know the weather of multiple places, Smooth animations, weather alerts.

I want to build an app with the name Find-a-Bull. Here, everyone from my university, the University of South Florida (the mascot is a bull) can find a partner studying at the university. The app is actually a dating app that lets you match with others on campus with the same preferences. It has features to share your photos and videos online. The recommendation engine analyses the profile and helps find the best match. 
## Notes

I came across various challenges while building the app.
- [ ] Linking the storyboard to the ViewController. 
- [ ] Debugging the code while determining the changes taking place in the application. 
- [ ] Making the logic behind the color change in both the Background and the Labels.
